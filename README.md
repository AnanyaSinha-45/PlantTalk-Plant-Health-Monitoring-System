# PlantTalk-Plant-Health-Monitoring-System
PlantTalk is an Arduino-based system that interprets plant health using real-time sensor data (moisture, temperature, light) and translates it into human-like emotions (ðŸ˜Š Happy, ðŸ˜“ Thirsty, ðŸ¥µ Stressed). Trained via Google Colab, the model's logic is implemented on Arduino Uno and visualized using an 8x8 LED matrix. Built for beginners, the system is fully simulated in TinkerCAD.
